The idea came after seeing solutions like MegaDRUM but it was closed source. The hardware is open source as well including Eagle Schematics and Eagle Board Layout. It is easy to use and build while being a robust product.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* 37 Input Triggers with 18 small audio jack connectors\r\n* It's a simple USB Device without need to install any drivers to run it reports as a MIDI Device\r\n* Positional sensing\r\n* Fully Customizable\r\n* Small Form Factor\r\n* Comes with a nice easy to use GUI Manager\r\n* Saves settings to EEPROM\r\n* Compatible with EZ Drummer, Addictive Drums, Fruity Loops, etc.\r\n* Cross Platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)\r\n* Can be configured from Android or iOS\r\n\r\n## Price and Bill of Materials\r\n- [Arduino Leonardo Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640)\t\t$4.13\r\n- PCB Board\t\t$8.30\r\n- [Audio Jacks](http://www.ebay.com/itm/141778008302?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)\t\t$6.87\r\n- [Rest of electronics]\t\t$2.5\r\n\r\n### Total **$19.24**\r\n\r\nI will be adding tutorials on how to build the DIY 3D Printed Drum Set, how to connect with EZ Drummer and Addictive Drums using ASIO4ALL, and aDrums Manager User Manual\r\n",
