The hardware is open source as well including Eagle Schematics and Eagle Board Layout. It is easy to use and build wile being a robust product.

## Features
* 37 Input Triggers with 18 small audio jack connectors
* It's a simple USB Device without need to install any drivers to run it reports as a MIDI Device

* Saves settings to EEPROM
* Compatible with EZ Drummer, Addictive Drums, Fruity Loops, etc.
* Cross Platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)
* Can be configured from Android or iOS
